EVALUATION OF SCANNING TAXONOMIES
Welcome abroad. This Projects evaluates Network Scanning Taxonomies for contribution to the greater good. Every one is welcome to contributed. The project serves as the artifact delivery for the bachelors thesis "AN EVALUATION OF SCANNING TAXONOMIES AGAINST IBR TRAFFIC". The full research will be avialable soon.


Project Description
Each folder represents pyhton version of a Network Scanning Taxonomy. The scripts are based on the orignal researchs from the authors in the folder name. The scripts are not a perfect representation of the taxonomies of which they are based, but data processing shows similar resaults. 

The two taxonomies created for The bachelor thesis is:
- Barnett, R. J. and Irwin, B. (2008)
- Liu, J. and Fukuda, K. (2018) 

Both scripts use Python and dpkt for fast packet capture parsing. 500MB of packet captures takes about 15-20 minutes to be analysed

Instructins
1. Clone repository
2. Open main.py for wanted taxonomy
3. Add Packet Capture files (PCAP) to 'pcap' varaible
4. Run script in Python

For better analysing purposes, all dicts are created in the main.py. Print out the dicts that interests you!
